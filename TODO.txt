1. Create Inode structure.
2. Create Directory layout.
3. Define Inode operations.
4. Define Directory operations.
5. Define address space operations.
6. Define superblock and its super operations.

Make a block group of 100MB.
With max size of 80k, roughly 100k as file size we can fit 10 files in 1MB. Then 1000 files in
100 MB. so we need to have space for 1000 inodes in a block. With size as 1024, 4 inodes can come in a block. With means we need 250 inode blocks for 100MB.
